A mostly complete RadioRA2 python library and functioning demo app

Lutron's RadioRA2 lighting system is pretty awesome, but their software clients are mediocre at best, and there are no desktop clients.

--Usage--

In the simplest scenario, you have to at least import the library and then setup a controller and a house. From there, you can run the load funtion on your house, and RadioPY will download and parse the database from the controller.

[example code]
from radiora import *

radiora = Controller(<IP address>, <username>, <password>)
house = House(radiora)
house.load()
